abstract: The inhibitory cascade (IC) represents a developmental model that
  explains the evolution of molar relative sizes, originally described in
  rodents but later validated in several mammalian groups. The IC comprises
  signalling molecules produced by the first molar buds that inhibit the
  development of subsequent molars and molecules from surrounding tissues that
  have opposite effects. Sloths, as xenarthrans, present many peculiarities in
  their dentition, like tooth and enamel loss, homodonty, and changes in the
  typically mammalian dental formula. Here, we test the existence of an IC and
  explore the evolution of the lower dentition in sloths. We studied the
  variability of molariform proportions in 20 specimens of the Late Pleistocene
  ground sloth Lestodon armatus. We also analysed molariforms proportions in 53
  sloth genera to explore evolutionary trends. Our results show that the lower
  dentition of most sloths complies with the IC model, despite the difficulties
  of assessing dental homologies with other mammals. Furthermore, we tested the
  existence of different patterns among families, obtaining support for models
  taking mylodontids and orophodontids separately from the rest of sloths. Also,
  members of Mylodontidae show a unique IC pattern, with a slope considerably
  higher than 2 and an mf1 ≤ mf2 << mf3 configuration. This pattern could be
  related to the morphological adaptations to grazing showed by mylodontids
  during most of their evolutionary history.
