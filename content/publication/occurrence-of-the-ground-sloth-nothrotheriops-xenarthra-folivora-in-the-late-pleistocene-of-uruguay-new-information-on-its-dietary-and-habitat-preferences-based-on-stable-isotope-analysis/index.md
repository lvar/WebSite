abstract: "Sloths represent one of the most successful South American clades
  that reached North America during the Great American Biotic Interchange
  (GABI). At least four families are known from the Pleistocene of North
  America: Mylodontidae, Megalonychidae, Megatheriidae, and Nothrotheriidae.
  Members of the Nothrotheriidae are known from the Middle Miocene to the
  Pleistocene/Holocene transition in the Americas, but Nothrotheriops is the
  only genus in the family recorded in North America. Recently, femora with
  characteristic nothrothere morphology were recovered from Santa Fe, Argentina,
  and assigned to Nothrotheriops, thus greatly expanding the geographic
  distribution of this taxon. In Uruguay, records of Quaternary Nothrotheriidae
  are scarce, and previous reports are limited to the genus Nothrotherium. In
  this work, we describe a humerus from Arroyo del Vizcaíno (AdV), a ~30 ka site
  located in southern Uruguay, and assign it to the nothrotheriid Nothrotheriops
  sp. We also discuss several specimens from Uruguay originally assigned to
  Nothrotherium, which upon re-examination can be tentatively reassigned to
  Nothrotheriops sp. Furthermore, we employ stable isotope analysis to explore
  the climatic and dietary preferences of this taxon in South America. The new
  records are consistent with the materials reported from Argentina, thus
  providing new knowledge of the geographic distribution of the taxon, as well
  as its climatic and dietary preferences. Stable isotope results showed δ13C
  values consistent with diets based mainly on C3 plants, similar to those
  published for N. shastensis in North America."
