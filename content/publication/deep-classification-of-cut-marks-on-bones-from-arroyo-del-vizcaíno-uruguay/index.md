abstract: The earliest widely accepted presence of humans in America dates to
  approximately 17.5 cal kyr BP, at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM).
  Among other evidence, this presence is attested by stone tools and associated
  cut-marks and other bone surface modifications (BSM), interpreted as the
  result of the consumption of animals by humans. Claims of an older human
  presence in the continent have been made based on the proposed anthropogenic
  modification of faunal remains; however, these have been controversial due to
  the highly subjective nature of the interpretations. Here, we employ advanced
  deep learning algorithms to objectively increase the accuracy of BSM
  identification on bones. With several models that exhibit BSM classification
  accuracies greater than 94%, we use ensemble learning techniques to robustly
  classify a selected sample of BSM from the approximately 30 kyr BP site of
  Arroyo del Vizcaíno, Uruguay. Our results confidently show the presence of
  cut-marks imparted by stone tools on bones at the site. This result supports
  an earlier presence of humans in the American continent, expanding additional
  genetic and archaeological evidence of a human LGM and pre-LGM presence in the
  continent.
