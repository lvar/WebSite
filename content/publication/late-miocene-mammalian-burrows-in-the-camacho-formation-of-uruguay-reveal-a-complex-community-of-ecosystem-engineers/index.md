abstract: "We report fossil mammal burrows from backshore beach facies in the
  Camacho Formation of southern Uruguay, of Late Miocene (Huayquerian SALMA)
  age. The presence of desiccation cracks and rhizoliths indicate the occurrence
  of relatively extended periods of subaerial exposure and the incipient
  development of vegetation. The analysis of the burrows' spatial extent, size,
  and structure reveals the existence of exceptionally well-preserved and
  intercrossing tunnel systems. We show the existence of different size classes
  of burrows, which indicate that at least four different taxa were responsible
  for their construction. Considering the inferred body masses of the trace
  makers obtained from allometric relationships and the body masses of taxa
  recovered for the Camacho Formation, the burrows may have been produced by a
  combination of the following mammals: one of several rodents, notoungulates,
  cingulates, folivorans, and a carnivoran. The fossil association represents an
  exceptional case of a community of ecosystem engineers in the Late Miocene of
  southeastern South America."
