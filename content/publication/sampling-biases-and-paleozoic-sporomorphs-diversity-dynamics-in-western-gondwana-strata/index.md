abstract: A dataset consisting of presence-absence data of 137 pollen and spore
  genera was elaborated with published sources from Pennsylvanian and Permian
  Atlantic (Paraná, Parnaíba, Amazonas, and Claromecó) and Pacific (Paganzo,
  Tarija, and Madre de Dios) basins of South America. The richness and
  origination, extinction, and sampling rates of sporomorphs were analyzed in
  order to address the effect of sampling biases over diversity estimations.
  Richness and sampling were estimated using the recently developed True
  Richness estimated using a Poisson Sampling (TRiPS) model. Origination,
  extinction, and sampling rates were estimated with Inverse Survivorship
  Models. The TRiPS analysis showed changes in richness during the studied
  interval. The highest richness was observed for the Cisuralian, and the lowest
  richness was recovered for the Pennsylvanian and Guadalupian. The best
  supported Inverse Survivorship Model revealed that the highest origination
  values occurred between the Gzhelian and Asselian, whereas the highest
  observed extinction rate occurred between the Kungurian and the Roadian. In
  particular, pollen grains showed higher net diversification than spores, while
  spores showed higher turnover than pollen grains. Also, an alternation in
  richness dominance was observed at the beginning of the Permian, with pollen
  grains showing higher richness after the Artinskian. Changes in total
  sporomorphs diversity, as well as differences between spores and pollen
  grains, may be related to changing climatic conditions in Western Gondwana
  during the late Paleozoic (from icehouse to greenhouse conditions) that could
  impact differently over plant communities. Although the fossil palynomorph
  record has been widely used as a biostratigraphic tool, our results highlight
  its importance and usefulness for the study of plant communities and their
  evolution in the past.
