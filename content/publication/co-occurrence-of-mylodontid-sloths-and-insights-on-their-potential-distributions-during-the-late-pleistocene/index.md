abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs) for the last interglacial (LIG),
  the global last glacial maximum (LGM) and the Holocene climatic optimum (HCO)
  were generated for three extinct South American Pleistocene mylodontid giant
  sloths, Glossotherium robustum, Lestodon armatus and Mylodon darwinii. They
  are recorded co-occurring in some localities including Arroyo del Vizcaíno
  site (AdV) in Uruguay. Co-occurrence records were studied based on the overlap
  of their generated areas of potential distributions, and compared with the
  available biome reconstructions of South America during the LGM to analyze
  their distribution patterns, ecological requirements and possible interactions
  between them. Our results suggest that these sloths could have co-existed
  mainly in the Chaco-Paraná Basin and the plains in the Río de la Plata area.
  Areas of high suitability were observed for submerged parts of the continental
  shelf that were exposed during the LGM showing an overall increase in
  potential habitat compared to the LIG and HCO. This suggests that there was a
  drastic reduction in total available areas of preferred habitat at the end of
  the Pleistocene. The co-occurrence of these sloths at the AdV site suggests
  the presence of vegetation indicative of mainly open, cold to temperate
  habitats but with mixed patches typical of humid climates.
