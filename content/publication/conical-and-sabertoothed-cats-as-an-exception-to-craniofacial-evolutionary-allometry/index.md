abstract: Among evolutionary trends shaping phenotypic diversity over
  macroevolutionary scales, CREA (CRaniofacial Evolutionary Allometry) describes
  a tendency, among closely related species, for the smaller-sized of the group
  to have proportionally shorter rostra and larger braincases. Here, we used a
  phylogenetically broad cranial dataset, 3D geometric morphometrics, and
  phylogenetic comparative methods to assess the validity and strength of CREA
  in extinct and living felids. To test for the influence of biomechanical
  constraints, we quantified the impact of relative canine height on cranial
  shape evolution. Our results provided support to CREA at the family level.
  Yet, whereas felines support the rule, big cats, like Pantherinae and
  Machairodontinae, conform weakly if not at all with CREA predictions. Our
  findings suggest that Machairodontinae constitute one of the first
  well-supported exceptions to this biological rule currently known, probably in
  response to the biomechanical demands and developmental changes linked with
  their peculiar rostral adaptations. Our results suggest that the acquisition
  of extreme features concerning biomechanics, evo-devo constraints, and/or
  ecology is likely to be associated with peculiar patterns of morphological
  evolution, determining potential exceptions to common biological rules, for
  instance, by inducing variations in common patterns of evolutionary
  integration due to heterochronic changes under ratchet-like evolution.
