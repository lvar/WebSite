abstract: For over 200 years, fossils of bizarre extinct creatures have been
  described from the Americas that have ranged from giant ground sloths to the
  ‘native’ South American ungulates, groups of mammals that evolved in relative
  isolation on South America. Ground sloths belong to the South American
  xenarthrans, a group with modern although morphologically and ecologically
  very different representatives (anteaters, armadillos and sloths), which has
  been proposed to be one of the four main eutherian clades. Recently,
  proteomics analyses of bone collagen have recently been used to yield a
  molecular phylogeny for a range of mammals including the unusual ‘Malagasy
  aardvark’ shown to be most closely related to the afrotherian tenrecs, and the
  south American ungulates supporting their morphological association with
  condylarths. However, proteomics results generate partial sequence information
  that could impact upon the phylogenetic placement that has not been
  appropriately tested. For comparison, this paper examines the phylogenetic
  potential of proteomics-based sequencing through the analysis of collagen
  extracted from two extinct giant ground sloths, Lestodon and Megatherium. The
  ground sloths were placed as sister taxa to extant sloths, but with a closer
  relationship between Lestodon and the extant sloths than the basal
  Megatherium. These results highlight that proteomics methods could yield
  plausible phylogenies that share similarities with other methods, but have the
  potential to be more useful in fossils beyond the limits of ancient DNA
  survival.
