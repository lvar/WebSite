abstract: Recently, Bocherens et al. (2017) studied the diet of extinct giant
  xenarthrans through the difference between the carbon isotopic composition of
  carbonate and collagen, so contending to have settled the debate on the
  alimentary preferences of the Pleistocene sloth Megatherium americanum as an
  exclusive herbivore, against proposals of a more diverse diet that could have
  included flesh to some extent based on ecological (Fariña, 1996),
  biomechanical (Fariña and Blanco, 1996), morphological (Bargo and Vizcaíno,
  2008) and even biogeochemical (Bocherens et al., 2016 - see below for
  discussion) evidence. Here we intend to show that, based on the data in the
  commented paper, such interpretation can hardly be claimed as fully
  demonstrated.
