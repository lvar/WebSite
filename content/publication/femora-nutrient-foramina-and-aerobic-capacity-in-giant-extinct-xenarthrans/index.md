abstract: Nutrient foramina are small openings in the periosteal surface of the
  mid-shaft region of long bones that traverse the cortical layer and reach the
  medullary cavity. They are important for the delivery of nutrients and oxygen
  to bone tissue and are crucial for the repair and remodeling of bones over
  time. The nutrient foramina in the femur’s diaphysis are related to the
  energetic needs of the femur and have been shown to be related to the maximum
  metabolic rate (MMR) of taxa. Here, we investigate the relationship between
  nutrient foramen size and body mass as a proxy to the aerobic capacity of taxa
  in living and extinct xenarthrans, including living sloths, anteaters, and
  armadillos, as well as extinct xenarthrans such as glyptodonts, pampatheres,
  and ground sloths. Seventy femora were sampled, including 20 from extant taxa
  and 50 from extinct taxa. We obtained the blood flow rate (Q̇) based on
  foramina area and performed PGLS and phylogenetic ANCOVA in order to explore
  differences among mammalian groups. Our results show that, among mammals, taxa
  commonly associated with lower metabolism like living xenarthrans showed
  relatively smaller foramina, while the foramina of giant extinct xenarthrans
  like ground sloths and glyptodonts overlapped with non-xenarthran placentals.
  Consequently, Q̇ estimations indicated aerobic capacities comparable to other
  placental giant taxa like elephants or some ungulates. Furthermore, the
  estimation of the MMR for fossil giant taxa showed similar results, with
  almost all taxa showing high values except for those for which strong
  semi-arboreal or fossorial habits have been proposed. Moreover, the results
  are compatible with the diets predicted for extinct taxa, which indicate a
  strong consumption of grass similar to ungulates and in contrast to the
  folivorous or insectivorous diets of extant xenarthrans. The ancestral
  reconstruction of the MMR values indicated a lack of a common pattern for all
  xenarthrans, strongly supporting the occurrence of low metabolic rates in
  extant forms due to their particular dietary preferences and arboreal or
  fossorial habits. Our results highlight the importance of considering
  different evidence beyond the phylogenetic position of extinct taxa,
  especially when extinct forms are exceptionally different from their extant
  relatives. Future studies evaluating the energetic needs of giant extinct
  xenarthrans should not assume lower metabolic rates for these extinct animals
  based solely on their phylogenetic position and the observations on their
  extant relatives.
