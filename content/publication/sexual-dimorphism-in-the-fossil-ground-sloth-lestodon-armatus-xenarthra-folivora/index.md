abstract: Mylodontidae (Mammalia, Xenarthra) is a family of ground sloths widely
  distributed in the South American fossil record, with members also present in
  Central and North America. Within the Mylodontidae, Lestodon armatus is the
  largest species, with an estimated body mass of more than three tonnes. This
  work focuses on the enlarged lower caniniforms of L. armatus as possibly
  exaggerated sexually dimorphic structures. Lower caniniforms from the late
  Pleistocene of Argentina, Uruguay, and Bolivia were studied using specimens
  from seven palaeontological collections. The possible sexual dimorphism in the
  caniniforms and its implications regarding the existence of sexual selection
  was assessed through morphometric analyses. The results support the existence
  of sexual dimorphism in L. armatus. Sexual dimorphism in an exaggerated
  structure in a large mammal suggests the existence of sexual selection, via
  competition between males or female mate choice, resulting in the evolution of
  the dimorphic structure. In L. armatus, the enlarged caniniforms would
  correspond to males and could have functioned as armaments in intraspecific
  fights or ornaments for sexual display. Based on observations in extant
  mammals, a polygynous mating system is proposed as highly probable in L.
  armatus, although the existence or composition of social groups cannot be
  certainly determined.
