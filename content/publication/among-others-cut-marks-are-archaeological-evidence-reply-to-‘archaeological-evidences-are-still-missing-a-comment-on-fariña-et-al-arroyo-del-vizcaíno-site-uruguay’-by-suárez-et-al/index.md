abstract: In Fariña et al. (2014), we claimed that a rich fossiliferous
  locality, Arroyo del Vizcaíno (hereafter, AdV), with marked bones that are
  much older than widely accepted for human presence in the Americas, deserved
  ‘to be included in the agenda of early American peopling, either as a not
  foreseeable discovery … or as an example of natural processes mimicking human
  presence’. The comments by Suárez et al. (2014) fail to offer a hypothesis of
  such a process. Instead, they mention we incur in ‘serious methodological
  problems and important interpretative errors’ that remain mostly unexplained.
