abstract: The extinct Gomphotheriidae is the only proboscidean family that
  colonized South America. The phylogenetic position of the endemic taxa has
  been through several revisions using morphological comparisons. Morphological
  studies are enhanced by paleogenetic analyses, a powerful tool to resolve
  phylogenetic relationships; however, ancient DNA (aDNA) preservation decreases
  in warmer regions. Despite the poor preservation conditions for aDNA in humid,
  sub-tropical climates, we recovered ∼3,000 bp of mtDNA of Notiomastodon
  platensis from the Arroyo del Vizcaíno site, Uruguay. Our calibrated phylogeny
  places Notiomastodon as a sister taxon to Elephantidae, with a divergence time
  of ∼13.5 Ma. Additionally, a total evidence analysis combining morphological
  and paleogenetic data shows that the three most diverse clades within
  Proboscidea diverged during the early Miocene, coinciding with the formation
  of a land passage between Africa and Eurasia. Our results are a further step
  toward aDNA analyses on Pleistocene samples from subtropical regions and
  provide a framework for proboscidean evolution.
