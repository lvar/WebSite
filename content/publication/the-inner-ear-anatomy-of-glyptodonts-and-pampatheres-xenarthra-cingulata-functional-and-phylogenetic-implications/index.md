abstract: In recent years, the increase in studies on the inner ear anatomy of
  xenarthrans provided new insights regarding some locomotor and phylogenetic
  aspects. These works have begun to include fossil specimens, although so far,
  only two extinct representatives of the suborder Folivora (ground sloths) have
  been analyzed. In the present study, we present the first reconstruction and
  description of the bony labyrinth of five extinct specimens of the suborder
  Cingulata, the glyptodonts Glyptodon, Doedicurus, Panochthus, and
  Pseudoplohophorus, as well as the pampathere Holmesina, in order to analyze
  their morphology and evaluate functional and phylogenetic aspects. The
  anatomical and morphometric comparison shows that the inner ear of glyptodonts
  is largely similar to that of modern armadillos, particularly sharing many
  characteristics with Chlamyphorus. While the inner ear of Holmesina is similar
  to that of glyptodonts, it presents some characteristics that make it more
  similar to extant armadillos. Regarding some functional aspects inferred from
  the anatomy of the semicircular canals, glyptodonts would have had low levels
  of agility, although similar to most extant armadillos, and low head angular
  velocity. On the other hand, Holmesina would have had an agility level similar
  to that of the giant armadillo Priodontes, although it would also present low
  head angular velocity as seen in most extant armadillos. Finally, preliminary
  parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic inference analyses based on a reduced set
  of inner ear characters showed interesting results, with glyptodonts and
  Holmesina recovered as closely related to Chlamyphorus. These results closely
  resemble the recent topologies obtained using ancient DNA and markedly
  contrast with the topologies obtained using more traditional morphological
  characters, highlighting the importance of inner ear data for the inference of
  phylogenetic relationships in cases where DNA preservation in fossil taxa is
  unaccessible.
