abstract: "The moment arms of jaw muscles and the hypsodonty index (HI) have
  been widely used to infer diet preferences in extinct species. Here, we intend
  to evaluate the use of the masseter moment arm and HI as dietary proxies in
  herbivorous ungulates and analyse its relations to diet preference, habitat
  selection and two continuous variables: percentage of grass in natural diet
  (%Grass) and annual precipitation (PREC). Masseter moment arm (Mm) showed a
  strong correlation to diet preference and %Grass but not for habitat selection
  and PREC. Contrarily, HI showed similar correlation with diet preference and
  %Grass but also with habitat selection and PREC. The results show that Mm
  predominately reflects adaptation to tougher, rich in grass diets, while HI,
  as previously found, indicates adaptation to the wear effect of both diet and
  environment. This approach has been useful in identifying the habits of two
  extinct very large Pleistocene South American ungulates. Macrauchenia
  patachonica, an extinct litoptern, is interpreted as an open-habitat high
  browser and Toxodon platensis, an extinct notoungulate, as a grazer."
