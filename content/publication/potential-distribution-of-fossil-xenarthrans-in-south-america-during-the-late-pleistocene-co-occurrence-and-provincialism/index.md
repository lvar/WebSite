abstract: "Species distribution models (SDMs) are helpful for understanding
  actual and potential biogeographical traits of organisms. These models have
  recently started to be applied in the study of fossil xenarthrans. SDMs were
  generated for 15 South American late Pleistocene xenarthrans: eight Cingulata
  (Glyptodon clavipes, Doedicurus clavicaudatus, Panochthus tuberculatus,
  Neosclerocalyptus paskoensis, Pampatherium typum, Pampatherium humboldtii,
  Holmesina paulacoutoi, and Holmesina occidentalis) and seven Folivora
  (Glossotherium robustum, Lestodon armatus, Mylodon darwinii, Catonyx cuvieri,
  Catonyx (=Scelidodon) chilensis, Megatherium americanum, and Eremotherium
  laurillardi). Models were evaluated for three periods: the last interglacial
  (LIG), the last glacial maximum (LGM), and the Holocene climatic optimum
  (HCO). Co-occurrence records were studied based on the overlap of the
  potential distributions and compared with the available biome reconstructions
  of South America during the LGM to analyze species distribution patterns,
  ecological requirements, and possible interactions. Our results suggest the
  existence of provincialization within xenarthran megamammals grouped in at
  least three bioregions. Northern and southwestern taxa overlap in the Río de
  la Plata region where also some endemic taxa are found. We observed
  overlapping potential distributions but separated and continuous realized
  distributions between closely related xenarthrans suggesting competitive
  exclusion. A generalized reduction in potential habitats at the end of the
  Pleistocene was not obvious as some taxa show stable potential areas during
  HCO when comparing with LGM. Nonetheless, fragmentation of the most suitable
  areas due to climate variation and the impact of reduction in available land
  due to sea level changes cannot be ruled out as involved in the extinction."
