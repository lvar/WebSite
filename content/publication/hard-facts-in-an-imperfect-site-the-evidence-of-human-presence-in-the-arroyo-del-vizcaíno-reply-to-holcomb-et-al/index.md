abstract: "With the excuse of writing a critique to Domínguez-Rodrigo et al.
  (2021, duly replied here: Domínguez-Rodrigo & Baquedano, 2022), Holcomb et al.
  (this volume) intend to deny the proposal that the Arroyo del Vizcaíno (AdV,
  Fariña et al. 2014) is a site with evidence of human presence in South America
  before the LGM. Among the flaws of their critique, it must be mentioned that
  they decide to utterly ignore a few lines of evidence that sustain the
  questioned hypothesis (mortality profile of the individuals of the megafauna
  found there, representation of their anatomical regions, relative proportions
  of the Voorhies groups, etc.), state misled interpretation of the chronology
  and stratigraphy, refuse to accept the presence of human-modified lithics and
  show also non-acceptance of the conclusions of our thorough study of the key
  evidence, the cut-marks (Fariña et al. 2014, Fariña 2015, Domínguez-Rodrigo et
  al. 2021), based on a purported ideal of how a site should be researched,
  which leave aside those that point out at different conclusions from theirs."
