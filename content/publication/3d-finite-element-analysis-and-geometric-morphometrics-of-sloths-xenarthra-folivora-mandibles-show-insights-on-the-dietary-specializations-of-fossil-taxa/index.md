abstract: Sloths are represented today only by two distantly-related small,
  arboreal, and folivorous genera. However, the fossil record of the clade is
  composed of many more taxa, with much more diverse morphologies, including
  giant terrestrial forms with no clear modern analogs. In this context, several
  approaches have been implemented in order to explore the ecological
  adaptations of fossil taxa and, in particular, their dietary preferences. In
  this work we used 3D Finite Elements Analysis (FEA) coupled with Geometric
  Morphometrics (GMM) to explore the ecomorphology of sloths and possible
  differences among taxa related to dietary adaptations. Digital models of the
  mandibles of 14 taxa were obtained (two extant and twelve extinct),
  representing members of all the major clades within the group. We modeled the
  actions of the three major muscles involved in mastication (masseter,
  temporalis, and pterygoideus) and simulated unilateral mastication in four
  different conditions, one for each tooth along the toothrow. The results were
  analyzed qualitatively regarding the distribution of von Mises stress (vMs)
  and quantitatively using the mesh-weighted arithmetic mean (MWAM) vMs, strain
  energy (SE), and mechanical efficiency (ME). Differences in the distribution
  of high-vMs areas and lower SE values were found among taxa predicted to be
  grazers in comparison to those predicted to be browsers. Furthermore, when
  simulating biting with the most anterior tooth, we observed considerably
  higher vMs and SE values in taxa with a caniniform, which could indicate its
  involvement in sexual display rather than in food processing, acquisition, or
  other strenuous activities.
