abstract: Understanding the role of megamammals in shaping terrestrial
  ecosystems and landscapes during the South American Late Pleistocene is
  crucial for estimating the impacts of extinctions on current ecological
  dynamics. Here, we aimed to investigate the mobility patterns and landscape
  use of the extinct giant ground sloth Lestodon armatus, a member of South
  America’s megafauna, where the Pleistocene extinction was the hardest. We
  report, to our knowledge, the first strontium isotope ratio (87Sr/86Sr)
  analysis for L. armatus, acquired from bone and dentin samples across six
  Uruguayan localities, including six individuals and serial sampling of a tooth
  from one of the sites. Our results show a highly localized 87Sr/86Sr signature
  for L. armatus in the study area, suggesting limited movement within a defined
  home range consistent with their body mass. These results rule out the
  existence of extensive seasonal migrations in this species. Finally, we
  complemented our isotopic results with a connectivity analysis to explore
  landscape connectivity in southern Uruguay during the Late Pleistocene. The
  results provide a baseline for studying the spatial ecology of megamammal
  communities in the region and expand the knowledge on how the extinction of
  large herbivores might have influenced landscape connectivity in South America
  during and after the Late Pleistocene.
