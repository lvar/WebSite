abstract: Human–megafauna interaction in the Americas has great scientific and
  ethical interest because of its implications on Pleistocene extinction. The
  Arroyo del Vizcaíno site near Sauce, Uruguay has already yielded over 1000
  bones belonging to at least 27 individuals, mostly of the giant sloth
  Lestodon. The assemblage shows some taphonomic features suggestive of human
  presence, such as a mortality profile dominated by prime adults and little
  evidence of major fluvial transport. In addition, several bones present deep,
  asymmetrical, microstriated, sharp and shouldered marks similar to those
  produced by human stone tools. A few possible lithic elements have also been
  collected, one of which has the shape of a scraper and micropolish consistent
  with usage on dry hide. However, the radiocarbon age of the site is
  unexpectedly old (between 27 and 30 thousand years ago), and thus may be
  important for understanding the timing of the peopling of America.
