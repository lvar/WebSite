abstract: Within the subfamily Scelidotheriinae, Valgipes bucklandi represents
  one of the least known taxa due to its scarce records and material found so
  far. This Pleistocene ground sloth had been registered only in Brazil, within
  the Brazilian Intertropical Region (BIR) in the states of Bahia, Minas Gerais,
  Piauí, Rio Grande do Norte and, more recently, outside the BIR, in Mato Grosso
  do Sul. A particular feature of this sloth is the proximal and distal fusion
  of the tibia and fibula in adults. Here, we report a tibia-fibula assigned to
  V. bucklandi found in Arroyo del Vizcaíno (Canelones, Uruguay), a
  fossiliferous site that harbors a large amount of megamammal remains at an
  approximate age of 30 ka (29696–32009 cal yr B.P.). We performed stable
  isotopes analyses and ecological niche models (ENM) to study V. bucklandi
  distribution and climatic and dietary preferences, as well as to better
  understand its presence ~2000 km southward of its previous recorded
  occurrences. δ13C values were consistent with those of the BIR, indicating a
  similar preference for C3 plants, while the results of δ18O values could be
  related to colder and more humid environments, clearly different from those
  obtained from BIR specimens. Furthermore, the ENM results also showed colder
  and more humid environments for the AdV record, with the occurrence being in
  the margins of the predicted potential distribution of the taxa. This
  discovery expands the distribution of this taxa to southern colder climates,
  indicating a greater climatic tolerance. Moreover, our results support the
  existence of mixed faunas composed of Southern and Northern taxa coexisting in
  Southern Uruguay at the onset of the Last Glacial Maximum, and provide
  evidence of the existence of an open mosaic habitat with patches of mixed
  vegetation in the region.
