abstract: Sloths, like other xenarthrans, are an extremely interesting group of
  mammals that, after a long history of evolution and diversification in South
  America, became established on islands in the Caribbean and later reached
  North America during the Great American Biotic Interchange. In all three
  regions, they were part of the impressive Pleistocene megafauna. Most taxa
  became extinct and only two small, distantly related tree-dwelling genera
  survived. Here, we incorporate several recently described genera of sloths
  into an assembled morphological data supermatrix and apply Bayesian inference,
  using phylogenetic and morphological clock methods, to 64 sloth genera. Thus,
  we investigate the evolution of the group in terms of the timing of divergence
  of different lineages and their diversity, morphological disparity and
  biogeographical history. The phylogeny obtained supports the existence of the
  commonly recognized clades for the group. Our results provide divergence time
  estimates for the major clades within Folivora that could not be dated with
  molecular methods. Lineage diversity shows an early increase, reaching a peak
  in the Early Miocene followed by a major drop at the end of the Santacrucian
  (Early Miocene). A second peak in the Late Miocene was also followed by a
  major drop at the end of the Huayquerian (Late Miocene). Both events show
  differential impact at the family level. After that, a slight Plio-Pleistocene
  decline was observed before the marked drop with the extinction at the end of
  the Pleistocene. Phenotypic evolutionary rates were high during the early
  history of the clade, mainly associated with Mylodontidae, but rapidly
  decreased to lower values around 25 Ma, whereas Megalonychidae had lower rates
  at the beginning followed by a steady increase, peaking during the Late
  Miocene and the Pliocene. Morphological disparity showed a similar trend, with
  an early increase, followed by a slowly increasing phase through the Late
  Oligocene and Early Miocene, and ending with another increase beginning at the
  middle of the Miocene. Biogeographic analysis showed southern South America as
  the most probable area of origin of the clade and the main region in which the
  early diversification events took place. Both Megatheriinae and
  Nothrotheriinae basal nodes were strongly correlated with Andean uplift
  events, whereas the early history of Mylodontidae is closely associated with
  southern South America and also shows an early occupation of the northern
  regions. Within Megalonychidae, our results show Choloepus as a descendant of
  an island dispersing ancestor and a probable re-ingression to South America by
  a clade that originated in Central or North America.
