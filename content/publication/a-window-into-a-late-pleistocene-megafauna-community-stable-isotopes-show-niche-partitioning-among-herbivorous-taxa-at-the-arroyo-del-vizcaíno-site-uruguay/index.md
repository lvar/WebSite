abstract: "The analysis of stable isotopes on fossil mammals has become a widely
  used tool for understanding the paleoecology and paleodiet of these organisms.
  In this work, we study the stable isotope composition of collagen (δ13C and
  δ15N) and bioapatite (δ13C and δ18O) of fossil bones from Arroyo del Vizcaíno,
  a fossiliferous site in southern Uruguay dated to ∼32 ka cal BP. Fourteen taxa
  were analyzed: the ground sloths Lestodon armatus, Glossotherium robustum,
  Mylodon darwinii, Valgipes bucklandi and Nothrotheriops sp.; the glyptodonts
  Glyptodon reticulatus, Panochthus tuberculatus, and Doedicurus clavicaudatus;
  the equids Hippidion principale and Equus neogeus; the proboscidean
  Notiomastodon platensis; the notoungulate Toxodon platensis; the saber-tooth
  felid Smilodon populator; and an indeterminate cervid. In general, the
  percentage of nitrogen in collagen and the C:N ratio were within the limits
  expected for collagen preservation in fossil bone. The δ13C and δ15N results
  of the herbivores indicated that most taxa consumed high proportions of C3
  plants in open, relatively dry environments, but significant variations were
  observed. Furthermore, relatively high values of δ18O in bone bioapatite,
  which approximately tracks local drinking water, indicated low precipitation
  and/or high evaporation. Our results show that the herbivorous taxa present at
  the site covered a considerable range of the grazer-browser spectrum and
  support the existence of niche partitioning among closely related taxa.
  Overall, these kinds of approaches are indispensable to better understand how
  these communities thrived during the Pleistocene in the region, supporting an
  outstanding number of giant species, before their extinction at the
  Pleistocene-Holocene transition."
