abstract: A previous study reported the fusion of spinous processes of thoracic
  vertebrae one and two in the ground sloth Glossotherium, proposing an injury
  or a congenital deformation as possible causes. In this paper we examined
  members of four families of Pleistocene sloths (Mylodontidae, Megatheriidae,
  Nothrotheriidae and Megalonychidae) to document the presence of this condition
  in different genera. We found that of nine genera analyzed, Glossotherium and
  Megalonyx were the only that present fusion of the spinous processes, which
  consistently occur between T1 and T2. When only identified T1 and T2 were
  considered, the incidence of the fusion was 87.5% in the case of Glossotherium
  and 40% in the case of Megalonyx. The high incidence of fusion in almost only
  one genus almost certainly would preclude the possibility of having been
  caused by an injury. We discuss the possibility that the observed fusions
  could be related to a pathological condition, or a mechanical response due to
  repetitive movements or particular habits.
