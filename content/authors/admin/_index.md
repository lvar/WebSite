I am a paleontologist from Uruguay, South America. I am currently doing my PhD on macroevolutionary and macroecological aspects of fossil xenarthrans, one of the most important groups of the South American native megafauna. I also work using 3D models of fossil bones to answer various questions about these animals, like what they ate or how hard they bit. I am interested in the conservation and valorization of fossil collections and the use of new technologies in these activities.
